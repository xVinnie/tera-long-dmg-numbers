### What it do 

HUGE DPS BOOST

It basically multiplies the damage you deal by the value set in the script, by the default being `10000`. This can be changed to your liking via editting the `multiplier` value found in `tera-long-dmg-numbers\settings.json`. The module can be set to load disabled by setting `enabled` to false as well. There's also in-game commands, wow. 

#### In-game Commands

* ***`/!lmn`***  *`[on/off]`* turns on and off the whole module functionalities.
######
* ***`/!lmn`*** *`multiplier` `new multiplier value(number)`* sets a new damage muliplier.

*Note: Settings will be autosaved if using Caali's proxy when exiting the game. I have no idea why it's broken with pony's proxy, will probably fix it later /shrug.*
